Immediate Priorities for implementing first game
------------------------------------------------

implement the following actions
    take
    place/drop
    light/strike


Later Priorities for completing the project
-------------------------------------------

Deploy on Pi (or another constrained environment)
Documentation to "build, deploy, use the artifact"
re-write this README.md (250-500 words, explaining the project in its history of video game context)
Bui encourages us to have some game literature
    Idea for this: two pages (one page front and back)
        front page: gives description of the game, context, the story and base instructions
        back page: how to beat the game

Would Like to Haves
-------------------

Jenkins actor
text file that we can pipe into the executable that wins the game
